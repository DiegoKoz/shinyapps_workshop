# Practice

For the **Guided Practice**, we are going to build two shiny apps:

1.  Palmer Penguins
2.  Gapminder

Plus, we are going to take a quick look at to very useful topics:

3.  Passwords
4.  Modules

For the **Independent Practice**, you should:

1.  Take the visualizations you built on the independent practice from the dataviz section

2.  Build a function that wrap the visualization

3.  Add parameters for customization (could be a filtering, choosing a variable, even a type of plot)

4.  Build a shiny app that shows the visualization:

    1.  *Hint:* use a template!

    2.  *Hint*: start by showing the visualization with hardcoded parameters, and later add the interactivity

5.  Customize the app: Add explanations, tables, etc.
