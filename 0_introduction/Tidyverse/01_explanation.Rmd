This is a brief introduction to the `tidyverse`[__tidyverse__](https://www.tidyverse.org/) so we can stablish a common ground for our Dataviz course. 

The `tidyverse` is a group of packages that have a common logic in their design and are usually used together.
Within those packages, the most popular are  __dplyr__ and __tidyr__ to transform and reshape our data. __ggplot__ is used for dataviz, and we'll see that on the next session.
      
We can load all those packages together
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)

```

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df <- penguins
```

### Dplyr

In the tidyverse we use a lot the __pipes__ `%>%.

The pipes work like in linux the `|` or in python the `.`. it takes what's on the left, and it makes the transformation with the function on the right. For example:

$f(x,y)$ is equivalent to $x$ %>% $f(.,y)$ 

Let's see some popular functions from _dplyr_:

#### glimpse

We can see an overview of our dataset:

* Number of rows
* Number of columns
* Name of columns
* Data types
* First few observations

```{r, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(df)
```

#### filter

It filters _rows_ following a logic condition
 
```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(island == 'Biscoe', flipper_length_mm<180)
```

When we split the conditions with __,__ we are asking for both conditions at the same time. In case we want _either one of the conditions_, we use __|__

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(island == 'Biscoe'| flipper_length_mm<180)
```

#### select

Allows to make a subset of columns. We can either specify those we want, or those we do not want (adding a _-_)

```{r}
c(1,2,3)
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  select(island,species)

df %>% 
  select(-c(island,species))
```

#### mutate

With mutate we can create or transform columns, using rowwise operations

```{r}

df %>% 
  mutate(bill_length_cm = bill_length_mm/10) %>% 
  select(bill_length_mm,bill_length_cm,year) %>% 
  mutate(bill_length_cm = bill_length_cm + 100,
         year = year+10)
```

#### case_when


This allows to assign values following multiple logical conditions



```{r}
df$species %>% unique()

df %>% 
  mutate(first_letter = case_when(species == "Adelie" ~ 'A',
                                  species == "Gentoo" ~ 'G',
                                  species == "Chinstrap" ~ 'C',
                                  TRUE ~ NA_character_)
         ) %>% 
  select(species, first_letter)
```

The `TRUE ~ NA_character_` allows us to classify all other missing cases


#### summarise

This creates a new table that aggregates the original data.


```{r}
max(c(1,2,3,5,NA), na.rm = TRUE )
```

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(island == "Torgersen") %>% 
  summarise(max_bill_length = max(bill_length_mm,na.rm = T),
            min_bill_depth = min(bill_depth_mm,na.rm = T))
```

#### group_by

This can be combined with a summarise (or mutate) to make the operations for each group

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(island,species,year) %>% 
  summarise(max_bill_length = max(bill_length_mm,na.rm = T),
            min_bill_depth = min(bill_depth_mm,na.rm = T))

```

### Joins

Another important functionality are the joins


![source: http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/227171_618ebdce0b9d44f3af65700e833593db.html](img/joins.png)         


#### left_join    

As a silly example, we could add the previously made dataframe to the original one

```{r}
summary_data <- df %>% 
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarise(mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm,na.rm = T),
            mean_bill_depth = mean(bill_depth_mm,na.rm = T))


df %>% 
  left_join(summary_data, by = "island") %>% 
  select(species,island,bill_length_mm,bill_depth_mm, mean_bill_length,mean_bill_depth)
```


### Tidyr

With this package we will be able to reshape our data in long/wide formats


We can use wildcards to define which part of the column names it should take to the new column


```{r}
pv <- penguins %>% 
  select(-sex, -year) %>%
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>%
  pivot_longer(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g, names_to = 'type')
```

```{r}
pv %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = 'type',values_from ='value' )
```


```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(!is.na(sex)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = bill_length_mm:bill_depth_mm, names_pattern =  'bill_(.*)_mm') 
```

This functions are really complete and useful, so it worth reading the documentation:
